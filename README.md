# knowledge-banking

This repo contains experiments in pulling together and curating public data and information sources to make contributions to the "knowledge commons." Folders are individual experiments built and operated in the [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com) environment. They may contain requirements.txt files with Python package dependencies along with a Dockerfile where necessary to build specific custom environments.
