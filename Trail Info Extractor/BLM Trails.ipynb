Oregon/Washington seem to have the most robust GIS program with their own data management area complete with what appear to be more State-level data standards and models. Colorado, which is what I'm looking to in this case, has several specific trails-related data assets via their ArcGIS Hub catalog. The state-level dataset with GTLF in the description does have many more properties than the National aggregation and includes fields for created and modified dates.",

The \"BLM CO Roads and Trails\" is also sourced from a BLM data server (gis.blm.gov/coarcgis), with the ArcGIS Hub record simply a metadata record in that catalog pointing to a BLM source. A quick look at a couple of other areas shows that Utah doesn't have any trails data source listed in their transportation category, though they do have a dataset for UT's part of the National Scenic and Historic Trails. Other states like Idaho also don't have any trails data that can be found readily in the ArcGIS Hub. My guess is that what the BLM ArcGIS Hub presents is something of an ideal that BLM is striving to achieve with some level of consistency across the States, but it looks like they are a long way off from achieving this.",

OBJECTID is listed in the standards documentation, but this appears to be a simple sequential numeric identifier for geospatial features in the dataset that shouldn't be used for anything other than internal consistency. GlobalID is also discussed in the standard but is documented as a \"software generated value\" that shouldn't be used as a meaningful unique ID. The presence of a property labeled Original_GlobalID makes me wonder a bit at the internal data management workings over time and why these properties are even included if they are not truly usable for anything. The only other identifier property that seems to be in this form of the data is FAMS_ID, which is documented as a link to another BLM system, the Facility Asset Management System, and is not populated for every record.",

The following code blocks make an attempt at reading the PDF brochure for the GGNCA. This requires the tabula-py wrapper on a Java process, and so a JVM needed to be installed in the Deepnote environment. After looking at both this option and another Python approach with Camelot, I'm concluding that this particular PDF is probably not going to be conducive to me parsing it out for trails information from code.

We have no really good way to use BLM data/information sources as the primary references for injecting new trail entities into Wikidata, at least not programmatically and at scale. If I end up taking an approach where I essentially go through and carefully curate the knowledge about trails one trail at a time, even if I do that in the form of a database that gets synced into Wikidata, this might be fine. If I wanted to do something completely with code, I don't see a way to get there from these sources alone or even as the initial starting point. At the very least I would need to come in with an a priori set of trail names, find those in the BLM GIS data, and then work with what I find.",

But there is some useful data here, particularly from the standpoint of an alternate and potentially better source of geospatial data from what the BLM has. At least with the name and geospatial data for a given trail from OSM and the BLM source on their ArcGIS Hub, we could potentially connect the dots. Improving OSM with additional useful tags at the same time we improve or add new records to Wikidata could be part of a code-driven process operated from an intermediary curation point we set up.",

   "source": "This exercise does leave me with a couple of interesting conclusions. I can see why no one has yet done this comprehensively. Nicely curated and clean public data about trails just doesn't exist outside the scope of any of the areas where someone for some reason has taken enough interest to develop such a resource. I can also see the tremendous intellectual capital investment that commercial companies like Natural Atlas, Gaia GPS, All Trails and others have laid out to build their own sources. The one effort here in the U.S. through the USGS National Digital Trails dataset is more of an simple amalgamation at this point, relying on best available declared sources of trails data from mostly Federal providers and not yet dealing with all the deeper semantics of a full integration.",

The knowledge model is inherent in those two platforms with slight differences in them making up for weaknesses one or the other might have on their own. A challenge exists in pre-existing data already in either one of the systems that has been contributed somewhat by happenstance rather than carefully thought out design. This could create collisions in trying to do something more systematically.",

I've also seen how I need to focus on both Wikidata and OSM and the relationships between them in this kind of exercise when the entities in question are also inherently geospatial features.",

While I may sometimes be able to use some code against an information source to work up my initial list of trails for a given area, I'll need to have something with trail names I can use as a starting point to go after information for claims (Wikidata)/tags (OSM). This is the type of scenario I've seen from other Wikidata contributors who end up using something like OpenRefine to work up some final details for a dataset that got into that form from some other means. Having used that same approach in other data integration exercises, I've got a lot of respect for OpenRefine and its method of recording provenance.",

In doing so, I will establish a provenance trace that should both promote trustworthiness in the end result and show that it's possible to improve things at the sources such that more direct contributions to the knowledge commons could occur at some point. Demonstrating and recording everything that has to be done with records from one place to another should be a helpful lesson. It should also let me automate at least some of this process within certain constraints.",
